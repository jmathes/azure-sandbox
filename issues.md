Tried to follow guide for quickstart center: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-quickstart-center
quickstart center linked to this: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication, saying I'd need to set it up by Oct 15
That page didn't have directions for setting up MFA in an obvious place. I searched and clicked around, finding that most links which I wish linked to an actual azure console page instead linked to documentation about a concept, not necessarily even about a page
Used the search feature to find this: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa
Tried to follow it , going here: https://entra.microsoft.com/signin/index/ and finding that the directions no longer apply. The page had been restructured. Could not browse to Protection > Conditional Access; doesn't exist
Used the search box to find a "Conditional Access" page: https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/PoliciesList.ReactView, which also seems to have UI for creating new policies, the next step in the tutorial, but that UI element is greyed out. Seems like it's a paid feature.
Seems as though free tier accounts are going to be unable to comply with mandatory MFA starting Oct 15
