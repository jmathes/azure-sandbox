0. ## Questions I have after watching:
   - Are cost management and cost analysis products? Or just suggestions for things to do?
1. ## Summary:
   - Costs can be unpredictable if you use competitive
   - Avoid overspending
   - Estimate costs
2. ## Abbreviated notes
   - Competitive billing is powerful
     - And makes money for MS I bet. Cynical.
   - You should have a plan
   - Cost mgmt and cost analysis are thing
   - There's a cost management page with charts and visualizations
     - You can customize and save views
     - You can share them
     - Budgets are just alerting on money
   - Don't pay for services or capacity you don't need
   - Azure Advisor - so clippy for cost? Personalized recommendations for cost, security, etc
