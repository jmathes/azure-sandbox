0. ## Questions I have after watching:
1. ## Summary:
   - Azure Global Infrastructure is big
   - Terminology of azure infra layout
   - Visualization hints
   - How to decide region
2. ## Body
   - Terminology
     - Geography
       - Fault tolerant
       - Ex: US, Canada, Inda, China
       - Has one or more regions
       - Local law scoped more-or-less
     - A region
       - There are 60 regions total
       - Is a set of datacenters with low latencey together
       - Ex. US-east, US-east-2, US-central, etc
       - When you deploy, you do it to a region
   - Play with it on the global infra page
     - https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore/
   - When selecting, consider:
     - Where are my users?
     - What regulations will I have to follow?
       - There's a compliance hub on docs.microsoft.com
     - Does the region have all the products?
       - There's a product availability by region page
