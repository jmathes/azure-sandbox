0. ## Questions I have after watching:
   - What is a "blade"? Seems like a web UI concept, maybe specific to this portal
   - What is an "app service"? Is that like app engine?
   - Is Azure Functions the same as lambdas and cloud fns?
1. ## Summary:
   - There's a $200 "free" trial
   - 12 months of free services
   - permenantly free services
2. ## You can get started
   - Free trial is 30 days or $200 of free credit
     - The $200 can be applied to anything
     - You can see list of free services online on the "free services blade"
       - https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/FreeServicesBlade
   - There are VM and "app service" videos coming up
   - You get 10 app services free
   - You get 1m "azure functions" requests per month for free
   - There's a SQL video coming up. You get a big SQL db free
   - There are other things, like blob storage, several sql dbs, etc
3. How to get the free services
   - During trial, move to pay-as-you-go pricing
     - This means "charge me if I run out of free stuff"
     - Credits will last until end of trial
     - You also get more free stuff and uninterrupted azure?
     - Also 40+ services have always-free amounts of svcs
